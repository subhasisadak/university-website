            Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.

            Prof Pranati Panda, from the National University of Educational Planning and Administration, talked about the changing role and expectations of teachers in India, and highlighted the perceived gaps in practice and policy regarding teacher performance and expectations. She noted the teacher responsibilities as reiterated by the RtE Act and gave examples of good practice in standards based on local context specificity and standards would need to be explicitly articulated going forward. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.

            All companies involved realize that to create real large-scale business opportunities more is needed in terms of education, building out a comprehensive ecosystem and getting more partners involved. But for each individual company, this goes beyond their scope of business and capacity to take a leading role. The scale and magnitude of such a program therefore makes it necessary to build a shared ambition & proposition and build a scalable business case with Dutch and US public and private partners.
